#Virtual Mouse and Assistant

This project combines webcam hand tracking and eye tracking technology to create a virtual mouse that can be controlled by the movement of the user's hand and eyes. In addition, it also features a voice assistant named Ramlal, which allows users to interact with the mouse using voice commands.
